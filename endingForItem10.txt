You took a step back from the door, knowing that it was not worth the risk. You had come so far, but you couldn't let your desire cloud your judgment. You turned around and started making your way back down the hill. 

As you walked, you reflected on the journey you had just been on, realizing that it was not the destination that mattered, but the journey itself. You thought about the people you had met along the way, the lessons you had learned, and the experiences you had had. You realized that the struggles and the challenges were what had made you who you were, and you wouldn't have it any other way. 

As you reached the bottom of the hill, you looked back up at the door one last time, knowing that you had made the right decision. You were proud of yourself for not falling into the trap of power and for choosing the path of integrity and humility. 

You went back home, it's yet another normal night. 

(Growl from the far beyond)

Or is itâ€¦.
