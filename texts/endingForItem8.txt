You got Orb of Wheat, for which exact power is unknown. It seems like you have to share it with cows, but you are not sure if you can trust them. After some conversation with them, you realize that you have the same father, and they are your sisters who were born outside of marriage. You eat the tasty orb of wheat together, and suddenly everything around you has stopped. It looks like time has stopped in the whole world. You look up in the sky and see a vast fireball approaching you at an abnormal speed. Nothing else is moving around you, not cows, not leaves on trees, not even bunnies that were fighting for a carrot. Abruptly, the fireball explodes in the air, and millions of ghosts come out of it and are headed your way. Some unknown force pushes you and the cows, so all of you fall to the ground without being able to move. The ghosts are getting very close to you! Once they approach you, they start getting inside you through your chest. What is it? Are they really ghosts? Suddenly you realize it is the souls of other animals. After all souls get inside your body, you feel released. You stand up and look in the sky to spot a fireball, but instead see the clouds come together. The sky seems clear everywhere else, but only in front of you there are so many of them. They are very dark and scary looking, like the worst storm that ever happened on Earth is above to come. Swiftly, they have disappeared and you see A Supreme Goat. He tells you that you ate the hero orb and that souls of all super goat heroes are yours now, and you have the superpower that even he doesnâ€™t have. Hence, you become a new Supreme Goat while your sisters become the first-time-ever Supreme Cows. You fly to the sky to your new kingdom to help the world from above!
