As you keep walking forward thinking about the situation that just occurred, you stumble upon an old man sitting on the side of the road who seems to be meditating. You decide to interrupt him by poking him with your horns. “You are the prophecy. Will you stay a regular boring goat, or will you become an actual GOAT?”, the old man says to you. It’s a hard decision to make that will shape your future forever. What will you do?
1 Become a GOAT
2 Tell the old man he is delusional
3 Forge your own path
4 Knock out the old man

You call him delusional. It turns out, he is a mage that can destroy the ENTIRE WORLD!! “You have made a very bad decision”, as he chuckles. He sneezes at you, turning you and everything in a 5 mile radius into dust.
