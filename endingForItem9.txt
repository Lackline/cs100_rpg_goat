You have leaped over one of your biggest obstacles and defeated this boss. After saving your homeland and the entire world, you decide to go back to your village to talk and explain this journey to your friends and family. On your way there, you hear a buzzing coming from the phone you have in your little pouch. It’s an unknown number but you decide to pick it up anyways. It’s the sheep you saved from before!!! Shockingly enough, she asks you out on a date and you say yes. Your relationship with her blossoms into true love, eventually leading to a proposal. They hold a ceremony for both your proposal and the feats you accomplished along the way. You lived happily ever after. 

Hope you enjoyed the game! <3
